# DataCamp-Data-Science-Projects

This is a collection of the projects I have worked on from datacamp.com, an online platform for learning data science. All of the projects are in python. 

These are guided projects, with DataCamp providing the narrative text describing the desired tasks with the data and myself providing the code to complete those tasks. I have made slight modications to the narrative text.
